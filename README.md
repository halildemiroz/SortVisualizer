  ## Sort Visualizer in C++
I started this project for learning basics of SDL and C++.
It took like one and a half hour maybe but i did learn some important things.
I watched a video about this project. You can find the video channel named The Builder on Youtube.
I watched his video first and take notes what to do and try to recreate it but but turns out i wrote the same code as he did so i am sorry.
Thanks again to The Builder
